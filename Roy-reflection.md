#Reflection on GPS 1.1
##Jeff Roy

* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I'm new to the entire concept of version control, so my main challenge was understanding the concept of a master version and branching.  Memorizing all of the Git console commands also took some time.

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

The GPS mostly reinforced what I'd learned through last week's exercises.  However, working in a pair reinforced the importance of version control when a project involves more than one person.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I didn't ask many questions of the guide.  My pair and I discussed some issues about the syntax of specific Git commands.  My pair also had previous experience with a different system of version control, so I asked a few questions about that.

* What still confuses you about Git?

There are a few commands I don't have a good grasp on yet, like the difference between PULL and FETCH.

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

I thought it went well.  We both seemed to have a pretty good grasp of how Git worked, and we were able to communicate what we did.  We made a few mistakes along the way (I almost pulled some changes directly to the master branch), but that's to be expected.  I feel like I have a pretty good grasp of Git and GitHub now.
