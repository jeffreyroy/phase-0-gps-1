#Reflection on GPS 1.1
##Andrew Palmes

*What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

N/A

*What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

The use of git fetch

*What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I often found myself asking if I was doing the right thing, or if they say any typos before entering terminal commands.

*What still confuses you about Git?

I can't say that I am confused about git, I'm just getting comfortable w/ the motions


*How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

It was great, the guide watched over us well and kept us on track, while Roy and I kept a great pace on the assignment.
